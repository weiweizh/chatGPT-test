Ask chat-gpt to help me generate a portfolio website quickly
Questions I asked:

write me a responsive portfolio website using tailwind css framework, html and javascript, the tailwind document website is https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation And I want the website to be in 3 section:
- Section 1:  about section introduce a senior product designer 
- Section 2: the main service this designer provides: product design, consultant, UI/UX design
- Section 3: the latest work with 3 screens of UI work sample of data table
- Section 4: contact section with a button once clicked will open the email portal to send an email to weiweizh2017@gmail.com

add contact section

Add a section of "latest work", use placeholder image and make it responsive:
- For 1440 px width, show 4 item, each item contains:"image, a tittle, and a short description, and a url link"

Use this placeholder image "https://cutewallpaper.org/24/image-placeholder-png/croppedplaceholderpng-%E2%80%93-osa-grappling.png"
